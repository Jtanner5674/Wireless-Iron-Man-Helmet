# Wireless-Iron-Man-Helmet
This code allows you to wirelessly control any iron man cosplay helmet that uses two servos as the turning mechanism.
Connect the servos to pin D5 and D7 on a wesmos d1 mini.

follow this guide for setting up arduino IDE: https://www.instructables.com/Wemos-ESP8266-Getting-Started-Guide-Wemos-101/

The servos will need an external power source. I connected both of mine to a single usb cable to power them using a power bank.

Feel free to upgrade my code, it uses a sinric pro Switch to work. 

If you turn it on or off it wont matter because either way it will just cycle open or close.
